# Fuzzy Clustering
A Python implementation of the fuzzy clustering algorithm C-Means and its improved version Gustafson-Kessel

## Datasets
These 2 algorithms were run on 3 different datasets: "iris" which describes 3 different kinds of flowers, ["pima"](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/pima-indians), and
"wine" which is a dataset containing feauteres describing 3 different types of wine

## Contents
The directory `fuzzy_clustering` contains the actual implementation of the algorithms while the folder `data` contains the 3 datasets.
Each dataset has a seperate sub-folder which contains plots showing how each algorithm was able to fit to that dataset and how each cluster is positioned and shaped
